"
Middleware in Express.js is a set of functions that can be added to the request-response 
processing pipeline. These functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
and can execute tasks or modify the request and response. Middleware functions are commonly used to perform 
tasks such as authentication, logging, parsing data, and more. 
They are added using app.use() or related HTTP method functions in Express and are executed 
in the order they are added to the application.

middleware advance:- 
Middleware functions take three parameters: req (request object), res (response object), and next (callback function to pass control to the next middleware).
Example:

const customMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('This is a custom middleware');
  next();
};
app.use(customMiddleware);

app.use -> har request par chalega (GET, Post, patch, delete)

app.get -> bs path pr chalega
