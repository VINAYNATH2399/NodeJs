/*
Sure, if you're referring to building a web application using Express.js in Node.js, 
here's a simple example to get you started. 
First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Create a new project folder and navigate to it in the terminal:

mkdir myexpressapp
cd myexpressapp

Initialize a new Node.js project by running:

npm init -y
Install Express:

npm install express

Create a file named app.js or index.js (or any other name you prefer) and add the following code:


const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
Save the file and run your Node.js application:
bash
Copy code
node app.js
Your Express.js server is now running, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. You should see the message "Hello, Express!"
