In MongoDB, you can use the logical operators $and and $or to combine multiple conditions in a query.

$and Operator:
The $and operator performs a logical AND operation on an array of expressions. It selects documents that satisfy all the specified conditions.

Example:

// Find documents where age is 25 and name is "John"
db.collection.find({
  $and: [
    { age: 25 },
    { name: "John" }
  ]
})
This query will return documents that match both conditions: age is 25 and name is "John".

$or Operator:
The $or operator performs a logical OR operation on an array of expressions. It selects documents that satisfy at least one of the specified conditions.

Example:

// Find documents where age is 25 or name is "John"
db.collection.find({
  $or: [
    { age: 25 },
    { name: "John" }
  ]
})
This query will return documents that match either of the conditions: age is 25 or name is "John".

Combining $and and $or:
You can also combine $and and $or to create more complex queries:

Example:

// Find documents where (age is 25 and name is "John") or (age is 30 and name is "Alice")
db.collection.find({
  $or: [
    { $and: [{ age: 25 }, { name: "John" }] },
    { $and: [{ age: 30 }, { name: "Alice" }] }
  ]
})
