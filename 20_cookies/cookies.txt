cookies ki bhi security increase ho sakti hai jisse hm kheta hai:-
   Signed cookies

  
Signed cookies ka use web development me security 
ke liye hota hai. Jab server aapko koi cookie bhejta hai (jisme aapke login details ho sakte hain), 
toh woh use ek chhupa hua code ke saath sign karta hai. Jab aap wapas wahi cookie server 
ko bhejte hain, toh server us sign ko check karta hai ki kya woh cookie sahi hai aur 
kisi ne use badal nahi diya hai. Isse aapki online jaankari ko surakshit rakha ja sakta hai.


       Some cookies limitation:- 

Cookies have some limitations that you should be aware of:

Size Limitation (साइज़ सीमा):

Cookies have a size limit of around 4 KB per domain. If you store too much information in cookies, 
it might not be saved or transmitted properly.

Security Concerns (सुरक्षा संबंधित चिंताएं):

Cookies are stored on the user's device, and they can be accessed and modified 
by the user or potentially intercepted by malicious actors. Therefore, sensitive information should be avoided or properly encrypted.

Domain and Path Restriction (डोमेन और पथ प्रतिबंध):

Cookies are associated with a specific domain and path. This means a cookie 
set for one domain won't be accessible to another, and the cookie's path 
determines which URLs on the domain can access the cookie.

Expiration (समाप्ति):

Cookies can have an expiration date. Once a cookie expires, it's no longer 
sent to the server, and the information it holds is considered outdated.

Client-Side Scripting (क्लाइंट-साइड स्क्रिप्टिंग):

Cookies rely on client-side scripting (like JavaScript) to be processed. 
If a user has disabled JavaScript, cookies may not work as expected.

Cross-Site Scripting (क्रॉस-साइट स्क्रिप्टिंग):

Cookies can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks if not 
properly secured. It's essential to sanitize and validate cookie data 
to prevent these security issues.

Cross-Domain Limitations (क्रॉस-डोमेन सीमाएं):

Cookies are subject to the same-origin policy, which means 
a cookie set for one domain won't be sent to another domain.
